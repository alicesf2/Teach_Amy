-HTML, CSS, and Javascript are specialized languages for web development
-HTML: used to create layout of web page, can view directly in browser, connects all outside links, style, functionality together
-CSS: used to stylize web page, needs to be connected to html file to work
-Javascript: used to add functionality/interactivity to web page, such as buttons, animations, search bars, etc., needs
to be connected to HTML
-Bootstrap: a template that makes it easier to create webpages, has pre-made webpage components such as navigation bars,
photo carousels, footers
  -consists of pre-made HTML, CSS, and Javascript files and scripts
  -must include specific links in HTML header to access (see Bootstrap documentation)
-Java: general purpose programming language - can be used for a variety of things
  -completely different from JavaScript
  -good for teaching fundamentals of coding
  -need to download development kit onto computer (see Java documentation)
    -I recommend downloading IntelliJ as your text editor, atom is more for web dev/multiple language support,
    IntelliJ more specialized for Java
